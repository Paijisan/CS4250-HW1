              West Texas. Wide open highways, sprawling landscapes. Really beautiful country. But unfortunately, now also home to the largest measles outbreak in the state in 30 years. You probably know measles from its signature spotted red rash, but otherwise, you know, we really haven't had much reason to talk about it since it was essentially eliminated here in the United States back in 2000. For a long time, we simply didn't have any new cases. Nobody was getting sick of measles. And that, of course, was thanks to the development of the measles vaccine in the 1960s. But the thing about measles is that it is one of the most contagious viruses on the planet, and that means the vaccination rate doesn't have to drop by too much for it to start to spread. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, they said a 95% vaccination rate goal for kindergartners. What does that mean? Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. MMR vaccine to help prevent outbreaks. Now that is a high number. But when a virus is very contagious, you need a higher vaccination rate to keep it at bay. And when it's lower, the virus has the opportunity to quickly take hold. And that is exactly what we are seeing now in West Texas. That's where the outbreak started in this tight knit, rural, under vaccinated Mennonite community.

              But again, because it is so contagious, more and more measles cases are starting to be reported in other parts of the state. So with all that in mind, I recently traveled down to Texas to learn more about the outbreak, how it exactly started, how it could be contained, and overall how the community is feeling about the situation. I'm Doctor Sanjay Gupta and this is Chasing Life. Okay, let's start with the basics. Measles is a virus, and it spreads when someone who is infected breathes, coughs, or sneezes, and then another person inhales those infected droplets. Now, I've said this a couple times: it is highly contagious. But what does that mean exactly? Well, think of it like this. It is so contagious that it's estimated that someone with measles can infect nine out of ten unvaccinated close contacts, and it can also linger in the air, and it can linger on surfaces up to two hours after an infected person has left the room. Symptoms will typically begin 10 to 14 days after exposure. Think about that. It can be hard to remember what you were doing, where you were 10 to 14 days ago. The symptoms will typically include a high fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis or red eyes. And then again, most notably a red blotchy rash all over the body. Now what I think is important to note, especially if you have children. Measles can cause serious respiratory and neurological complications. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the United States with measles will be hospitalized. 20%. This is the reality doctors in West Texas are now facing.

              That's doctor Lara Johnson. She's the chief medical officer, a covenant children's in Lubbock, Texas. It's about an hour and a half northeast of Gaines County. Now, it is worth pointing out so many of the people who get infected with measles, who get sick, who need to be hospitalized. They are children.

              Well, you know, I would say the acute management, it's not that different than other viral illnesses that we deal with. So one of the most important things is making sure that we're identifying those patients as quickly as possible so we can limit exposure to other patients and staff. And then of course, assessing what their needs are. Most of the patients who've been admitted have had respiratory issues. They've been needing supplemental oxygen and respiratory support to help them get over the viral pneumonia part that we see with measles.

            <div class="clip-script">
              You know, that's a that's a good question. I think overall we're better at taking care of acute respiratory illnesses in children now than we have been in the past. We're probably also better at taking care of some of those acute neurologic things, just because our ability to provide supportive care may have improved. But I think even even with those things, you know, measles can still be deadly. We know that from from previous experiences, measles still can have serious consequences. And even one of the things that I think is sort of most concerning about measles is there is a condition that can develop years and years later after having measles that is neurologically devastating and fatal and happens, you know, seven plus years after the fact. And I don't think we've made any progress in, in some of those things. So, you know, I think our, our ability to provide acute supportive care continues to improve, which is great, but that that doesn't solve all those problems necessarily. And, you know, one of the other impacts, just thinking about a community with measles is it also has kind of a fairly long incubation period and then a long period of time in which symptoms may develop. If you're exposed, that's a 21 day period of potential quarantine. So, you know, that can have such a significant impact on students missing school for that period of time, parents missing work for that period of time. Employers having employees that can't come to work for that period of time. Just the sort of ripple effect of an outbreak like this can be really significant in lots of other ways.

              I think the number one thing that we're trying to push is vaccines. We've had this same MMR vaccine mumps, measles, rubella vaccine since the 1960s. It's got a proven track record. It's really it builds strong immunity. It benefits really outweigh the risks. And we've got such a track record with this vaccine. And we know it can protect people during these measles outbreaks that we are really trying to get everybody vaccinated.

              I think that we're going to continue to see cases and what the next few months look like kind of depends on how effective we are at getting messaging out about, you know, making sure that people get vaccinated, that they stay at home if they're sick and and really trying to push that message through really trusted community leaders.

              No. And I'm an infectious disease physician. I've never diagnosed a case. It's because, you know, measles was declared eliminated from the United States back in the year 2000 because of the effectiveness of that vaccine. And it's only now with falling immunization rates, not just here in Texas, but across the country and around the world, that we're starting to see more of these outbreaks.

It is on us now to try to help get the message out about the safety and the strength of this vaccine, and really trying to let people know the benefits that so that we can contain it. I know that that people have concerns about vaccines and that is okay. But it's time now to talk to your health care provider about those vaccines and why they might be right for you and your family.

So let's get you started. Let's at least get this one done and encourage them to continue to be fully vaccinated for all the other things that they should be. We are offering all the free vaccine. Come get your vaccine. If you're not vaccinated, please come get it so we can stop it because we know how fast this spreads.

              I think you just you start reading more and more and you realize it's on national news and you want to learn more about the disease because you don't you haven't really heard of what it actually does. And it's a lot more alarming than I thought it would be and how contagious it is. And will the vaccine be effective for all of us? Because it's, I think, 97% effective, right? Are we going to be that 3% or are we going to be safe? So yeah, it is a little alarming.

              Well, I think that the whole conversation about immunities, that immunization is less and less about the vaccines and their effectiveness or their side effects, and it's more about politics and religion, that's a different conversation for a different day with somebody else. But, you know, there's a whole other side of that story, and it's about, you know, what we learn from Owen being premature. That there's a whole group of people, whether it be because of health or age or allergies or something else, they can't get those vaccines, so they don't even have a choice whether or not to be vaccinated. So then it's up to us who can or do get vaccinated to create that herd immunity that can protect them and everybody else that's at risk. All right. So I just I mean, it's really I think it's time that everybody like, takes a look just at your political reasons or your religious reasons, kind of think about that group of people that really take a deep look into what it is that you really believe and why you really believe that and see if not, there's just even a little bit chance, just for a little bit, that you could put somebody else's interest ahead of yours, especially since there's a group of people that can't make that choice, whether the vaccines can work for them or not.

              Now, if you're a new parent, that means getting your child two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first typically between 12 and 15 months, and the second around age four before starting school. This usually protects people against measles for life. Now, if you have an older child or you yourself are not vaccinated, officials say it is not too late. And as we saw in Texas, every shot can really make a difference. Thanks for listening. Chasing life is a production of CNN audio.
